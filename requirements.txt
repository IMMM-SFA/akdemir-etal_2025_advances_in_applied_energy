In order to run the models and visualization scripts, you would need to install the following Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- geopandas
- matplotlib
- shapely
- seaborn
- networkx
- pyyaml














- os
- shutil
- pathlib
- sys
- geopy
- pyomo
- datetime
- openpyxl
- pyarrow
- xlrd
- highspy

Also, in order to initiate the optimization step, you would need to install either open-source (e.g., HiGHS) or commercial (e.g., Gurobi or CPLEX) solvers. This study adopts a fully open-source approach in which the modeling tools, datasets, and the optimization solver we use (HiGHS) are all publicly available and free to use.
